/// ## Update pubspec.yaml
///

///
/// ```yaml
/// dependencies:
///   # Internationalization support.
///   flutter_localizations:
///     sdk: flutter

/// First, open your projectâ€™s ios/Runner.xcworkspace Xcode workspace file.
/// Then, in the Project Navigator, open the Info.plist file under the Runner
/// projectâ€™s Runner folder.
///
/// Next, select the Information Property List item, select Add Item from the
/// Editor menu, then select Localizations from the pop-up menu.
///
/// Select and expand the newly-created Localizations item then, for each
/// locale your application supports, add a new item and select the locale
/// you wish to add from the pop-up menu in the Value field. This list should
/// be consistent with the languages listed in the AppLocalizations.supportedLocales

We will provide an inclusive online platform and services for our users reflecting diversity. We will also strive to provide a workplace that respects diversity, and as employers, will seek to value individuality and accommodate individual employeesâ€™ needs.\n\nPromly pledges to partner with organizations that also value GenZ, not as a commodity, but as people, that care about long-term outcomes, and demonstrate a commitment to destigmatize mental health and/or to create other social benefits appropriate for kids and teens. We and our business partners will have the opportunity to create a positive impact, and we require that they meaningfully demonstrate their ability to set and maintain high standards, especially with regards to minors, and that they value their reputation above profit. Promly will secure business partners that agree to provide a valued service, skills training and/or knowledge.\n\nWhere a partner engages in marketing, the organization must follow all applicable laws and best practices for minors and also that are applicable to the product. Our partners should strive to not only meet minimum requirements, but to set standards in their dealings with their clients and our users. This is essential, because trust is difficult to win, and easy to lose.\n\nIn order to maintain our usersâ€™ trust, Promly will strive to ensure that our tech-enabled solution partners prioritize the security and safety of our users. We will complement the ongoing process of platform enhancement with the continuous improvement of user protections.\n\nPromly commits to being a model of responsible technology, a driver of social impact and social enterprise, and a leader and change agent in the field of teen mental health and social media.'**
